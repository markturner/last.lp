%section#intro
  %p== Below is a list of albums #{@user} has (probably*) listened to in full in the last week.
  %p * I say probably because all I'm actually doing is counting the number of tracks played. You might have played the same track 25 times, and that would mess this up a bit.

    %p== #{@user} didn't listen to any albums! More of the 'shuffle' type I guess.
