Last.lp albums now playing
--------------------------

This is a lightweight ruby app, using sinatra, that returns a list of albums that a given user has listened to in the last week, using data from Last.fm.

It's for people who, in this modern world of short attention spans, still prefer to consume music in the form of full albums, and for whom the very track-centric approach of Last.fm is missing something.

Feel free to steal it and do with it what you wish.
